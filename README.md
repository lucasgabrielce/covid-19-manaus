COVID-19
Covid-19 striked the entire world in 2020. In Brazil, the disease killed almost 400 thousand¹ people since the begning of the pandemic in the country (March 2021). Manaus, the capital of Amazonas State, and the most crowded city in the North area of the country, suffered terribly with the pandemic, due to its tropical climate which creates a favorable environment for many other seasonal diseases such as yellow fever, chicungunha, dengue fever, malaria and tuberculosis. The facts becomes even more drastic when we consider that Amazonas has the highest mortality rate for tuberculosis in Brazil.

Coming from Amazonas, and studing pulmonary diseases for the past 3 years¹, it is saddly to see your people suffering and where the situation is going. Due to that, I'm going to analyze some data from COVID-19 in Brazil and reflect about their impacts from someone who is coming from the "world capital of COVID-19"².

Join me as I review some public data on the biggest sanitary crisis of the moderna era, and analyze how it affected my homeland, Manaus.
